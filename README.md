# Cryptocurrencies

## Summary
You and Martha have done your research. You understand what unsupervised learning is used for, how It’s time to put all these skills to use by creating an analysis for your clients who are preparing to get into the cryptocurrency market.

Accountability Accounting, a prominent investment bank, is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. The company, however, is lost in the vast universe of cryptocurrencies. So, they’ve asked us to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.

## Analysis
The data is not ideal, so it will need to be processed to fit the machine learning models. Since there is no known output for what the client is looking for, we will use unsupervised learning to process data, reduce the principal components using PCA, and a K-means clustering algorithm to cluster the data, and use data visualizations to share the findings with the board.

## Results
In the end, 532 variations of cryptocurrency are being traded, and grouped into 4 classes. A table can be found in Jupyter Notebook with an extensive view of the 532 cryptocurrencies and their clusters.
